# Files that get installed on the SPLUNK INDEXER (Security Onion)

## installed during the instructions in the main folder
- inputs.conf
	- tells Splunk what local files and folders to monitor, in this case reading in JSON-formatted Zeek (Bro) logs
- props.conf
	- handles sourcetype and field formatting, field aliases (alternate ways to call a field), and field reporting (aka "send this field with this transforms.conf formatting to Splunk")
- transforms.conf
	- handles field extractions and transforms (re-arranging, etc)
	- portions of the Sysmon section derived from this [Splunk blog](https://www.splunk.com/blog/2014/11/24/monitoring-network-traffic-with-sysmon-and-splunk.html)

## optionally installed through the Splunk web GUI
### LOOKUP TABLES AND INSTRUCTION HAVE MOVED [HERE](https://github.com/bonifield/splunk-lookup-tables)

## CUSTOM FIELD EXTRACTIONS (in addition to those parsed from the raw event)

### notes about field meanings
- Image = official term for a compiled binary file
- Subject_* = the one performing the action in question; the account requesting a logon (service, user, etc) but NOT the actual account logging on
- Affected_* = combined evaluation field for Target_* , User_* , and other
- Target_* and User_* = the one being acted upon by the Subject
- New_Logon_* = the account for whom the new logon was created, i.e. the account logged on

### Sysmon
#### note although there are several fields listed in this section, there are really only mixes of plain, "Und" (underscores replace backslashes), "Short" (75 character truncations), and "Clean" (underscores replace backslashes and no double-quotes) for the various fields, depending on analyst needs, and for the sake of quick-and-dirty dashboard drilldowns (both backslashes and double-quotes *will* make the developer's life miserable making workarounds)
