# files with example Splunk queries
# PURELY A LIST OF INTERESTING FIELDS, THIS IS NOT AN ANALYSIS GUIDE

### TODO - paste those queries here, instead of inside individual files

### 06 July 2020
- added all example queries to a dashboard that can be copied directly into Splunk for easier reference

### Randoms
- Image = official term for a compiled binary file
- Subject_* = the one performing the action in question; the account requesting a logon (service, user, etc) but NOT the actual account logging on
- Target_* and User_* = the one being acted upon by the Subject
- New_Logon_* = the account for whom the new logon was created, i.e. the account logged on
